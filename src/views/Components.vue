    <p>
      Components are one of the key building blocks of the design system. Each
      component has been designed and coded to solve a specific UI problem, such
      as presenting a list of options, enabling submission of a form, providing
      feedback to the user, and so on. All of the components in have been
      designed to work harmoniously together, as parts of a greater whole. The
      Elements in the system will continually expanded upon. Use the navigation
      to your right to navigate through them.

      The Components are built with Tailwind and it's @apply function, this
      allows to implement BEM-Name conventions rather easily. Every component
      has a link to it's Figma file, allowing designers to start prototyping
      without the need to copy all the elements by hand. The Styleguide also
      offers the up to date Sketch Library.
