      Design your service based on the guidelines and components crafted for the
      Swiss confederation services, websites and applications.

    <p>
      This design system aims to deliver a comprehensive list and documentation
      of all elements governing the design of the Swiss Confederation. Use it to
      keep consistency with the digital services of the Swiss Administration.
      Avoid repeating design or development work thatâ€™s already been done.
