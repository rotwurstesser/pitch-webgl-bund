        Some elements might not be fully available or configured in this
        prototype. The Elements below serve as an example of how the
        documentation would look like.

      Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides
      better user experiences for everyone. An accessible product should:
    </p>
    <ul class="my-4">
      <li class="flex space-x-4">
        <svg-icon class="h-6 w-12" name="arrow" /> Give all users the same
        experience
      </li>
      <li class="flex space-x-4">
        <svg-icon class="h-6 w-12" name="arrow" /> Adapt to users and situations
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our Styleguide strives to write perceivable, operable, and understandable
      patterns for all usersâ€”including those employing a screen reader or other
      assistive technology. Individually accessible elements and components are
      part of building accessible products. Use this guide to design and build
      products that anyone can use.

      you to test it.
