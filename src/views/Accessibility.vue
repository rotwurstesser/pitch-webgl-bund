        These elements might not be fully available in this prototype. The

      Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides
      better user experiences for everyone. An accessible product should:
    </p>
    <ul class="my-4">
      <li class="flex space-x-4">
        <svg-icon class="h-6 w-12" name="arrow" /> Give all users the same
        experience
      </li>
      <li class="flex space-x-4">
        <svg-icon class="h-6 w-12" name="arrow" /> Adapt to users and situations
      </li>
    </ul>
    Our Styleguide strives to write perceivable, operable, and understandable
    patterns for all usersâ€”including those employing a screen reader or other
    assistive technology. Individually accessible elements and components are
    part of building accessible products. Use this guide to design and build
    products that anyone can use.
