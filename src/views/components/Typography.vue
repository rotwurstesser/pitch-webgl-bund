    <h1>Typography</h1>
    <p>
      Describe here the importance of typography in the swiss design history.
      Talk about the Font choice, Frutiger, and give some words about Adrian the
      Greatest. Rythme, precision, vertical spacings could be evoked too.

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings serve to structure the content of a page. The higher the heading
      is in the structural hierarchy (e.g. H1), the more important it is, and
      the more weight is given to it by search engines such as Google. Generally
      speaking, not too many hierarchical levels should be used, as this has a
      negative impact on the clarity of the structure. Heading levels H1 through
      H4 are therefore clearly differentiated in their formatting (while levels
      H5 and H6 are merely defined pro forma).
