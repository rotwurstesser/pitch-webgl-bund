    <h1>Typography</h1>
    <p>
      Describe here the importance of typography in the swiss design history.
      Talk about the Font choice, Frutiger, and give some words about Adrian the
      Greatest. Rythme, precision, vertical spacings could be evoked too.

    <h2>Suisse Sign</h2>
    The Design System uses Suisse Sign. What sets Suisse Sign apart is its large
    apertures – most evident in a, e, g, s – and the reworked uppercase glyphs.
    The design deviates from the classic Grotesk model, and instead tunes into
    the new sans serif as it emerged in the last third of the 20th century, with
    open shapes and a more economical set width. Suisse Sign covers a wide range
    of applications from small text sizes to big headlines. As the name implies,
    it’s particularly well suited for signage and wayfinding: Characters with
    open counters are less ambiguous and easier to identify from a distance. A
    letter like c can’t be mistaken for an o, even under poor lighting or other
    limiting viewing conditions. The barred I is another means that helps in
    situations were impeccable legibility is required. Suisse Sign comes in
    Thin, Regular, Semi Bold, and Bold, with italics for all weights.
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings serve to structure the content of a page. The higher the heading
      is in the structural hierarchy (e.g. H1), the more important it is, and
      the more weight is given to it by search engines such as Google. Generally
      speaking, not too many hierarchical levels should be used, as this has a
      negative impact on the clarity of the structure. Heading levels H1 through
      H4 are therefore clearly differentiated in their formatting (while levels
      H5 and H6 are merely defined pro forma).

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      To conform accessibiliity requirement titles have to respect a sequence
      from 1 to 6
